# üçΩÔ∏è SmartBite - Iteration Summary

## 1. Data Model & Collections  
We have structured our Firestore database to ensure **efficient data retrieval, scalability, and user-specific data security**.

### **Top-Level Collection:**  
- **`users`** ‚Üí Each user has their own data.

### **Sub-Collections (under `users/{userId}`):**  
- **`meals`** ‚Üí Stores meal logs for each user (`{mealId}` document). When a meal is added, its nutrition is automatically analyzed and stored within the meal document. Each document ({mealId}) represents a meal, allowing users to add, edit, and delete meals as needed.
  - ‚úÖ **Create** meals using `writeMealToDB()`.  
  - ‚úÖ **Read** meals and their nutrition using `fetchMeals()`.  
  - ‚úÖ **Update** meals using `updateMealToDB()`.  
  - ‚úÖ **Delete** meals using `deleteMealFromDB()`.  
- **`recipes`** ‚Üí Stores saved recipes.  

 

üìå **Database structure may change as needed** based on further requirements and optimizations.
